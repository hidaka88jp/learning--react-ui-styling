# react-ui-styling

This project is a collection of styling experiments using Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules in Next.js.  
It serves as a sandbox for testing and comparing different styling approaches.

## Goals
- Try out different styling approaches (Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, etc.)
- Organize experiments as separate pages for easier comparison
- Provide a reference for future projects

## References
- 『CSS設計完全ガイド』 (技術評論社, in Japanese)  
  Used as a reference to implement common UI components such as headings, buttons, cards, and accordions.  
  The book uses CSS and BEM for styling, but in this project I’m re-implementing them with Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules.
